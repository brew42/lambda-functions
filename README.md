### List of Lambda Functions
- [CloudFormation event handler](/cloudformation-event-handler-hb)
    - Receives CloudFormation events from an SNS topic and on stack complete events (CREATE_COMPLETE, CREATE_FAILED, DELETE_COMPLETE, DELETE_FAILED) triggers another SNS topic to send text notifications
- [GitHub commit handler](/github-commit-handler-hb)
    - Receives GitHub commit events, identifies the files that have been added, modified, and deleted in master and then calls corresponding events for maintaining a copy of the repository contents in an S3 bucket
    - Currently being used to copy CloudFormation templates from [honey-badger-cloud-formation](https://github.com/pariveda/honey-badger-cloud-formation) to a dedicated S3 bucket to help with the repeatability of the CloudFormation workflow
